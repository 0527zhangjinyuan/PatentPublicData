In this example we do a lookup to the names map to get the Cassandra
column mapped to the
keys, then attempt to add each value to the metadata object. CIFS is
mapped as a 'multiValue',
so all of those lines get added separately in metadata. Complexity comes
with processing
non-multiValue fields that are repeating in the file. The example shows
CLPR fields into
which will be set as a single value but we need to surround each entry
with paragraph tags
and take into account the spaces in front of the text in the lines that
do not contain the
key.
