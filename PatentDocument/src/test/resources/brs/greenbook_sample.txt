PAL  A golf glove is disclosed having an extra finger pocket between the index
      and middle finger pockets for securing one finger of one hand of a golf
      player between the fingers of the player's other hand.

PAC  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
PAR  1. Field of the Invention
PAR  This invention relates to a device designed to improve a golfer's grip on a
      golf club, and more particularly, to a device to assist a golfer in
      maintaining the proper position of the fingers of one hand with respect to
      the other hand on the club during the entire swing of the golf club.
PAR  2. Description of the Prior Art
PAR  From the prior art, a number of glove configurations and other devices are
      known for improving a player's grip on a golf club or to assure the proper
      positioning of the player's hands on the golf club. Such include gloves
      with special attachments for holding a player's fingers in position with
      respect to the palm of the hand, and gloves having straps adapted to fit
      around a golf club or to fit around the thumb of a player's opposite hand.
      One prior art device comprises a two-handed glove to force the two hands
      of a player to remain in a fixed position relative to each other.
PAR  As is well-known, a golfer adjusts his grip on the golf club and aligns the
      head of the golf club with the ball, while holding the club in front of
      himself. In aligning the head of the club with the ball, the player turns
      the club such that the face of the club's head is at the proper angle
      relative to the ball. It has become apparent, however, that during the
      swing, a player has a tendency to twist the club somewhat changing the
      carefully adjusted angle of the head relative to the ball. While a player
      may have a firm grip on the club while starting the back swing, as for
      example in an overlapping grip, there is a tendency for the fingers of the
      right hand of a right-handed player to move away from the fingers of the
      left and just prior to beginning the down swing in preparation for hitting
      the ball. Such loosening of the grip has a tendency to cause the club to
      twist, causing a change in the angle of the face of the club's head when
      it comes in contact with the ball.
PAR  Prior art gloves which are directed to maintaining a strong grip by means
      of the left hand do not aid in maintaining a proper position of the
      fingers of the right hand on the club. Certain prior art devices such as
      the two-handed glove mentioned above, or another known device consisting
      of a relatively thin sheet of flexible material which fits around the
      glove and having holes through which fingers of both hands are extended,
      are intended to fix the position of the fingers of both hands. They are,
      at best, awkward to use or difficult to manufacture, or both.
PAC  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
PAR  In accordance with this invention, a modified golfing glove is provided for
      improving a golfer's grip on a club, having a receptacle or restraining
      surface for holding one or more digits of one hand in a secured position
      relative to the digits of the other hand. In one illustrative embodiment
      of this invention, a standard golf glove is modified by the addition of a
      finger receptacle or finger pocket extending in a direction opposite the
      direction of the normal finger receptacles or pockets of the glove, and
      attached adjacent to the middle finger and index finger pockets of the
      glove. In a so-called overlapping grip, the little finger of the right
      hand of a right-handed golfer, may fit into the extra pocket. When so
      positioned, the little finger of the right hand will tend to remain
      securely nestled between the middle and index fingers of the left hand
      during the entire swing, avoiding an unwanted twisting of the club during
      the swing. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, several straps
      are extended between the middle and index finger pockets of a golf glove
      of one hand to provide a pocket for the little finger of the other hand.
PAR  In yet another embodiment of my invention, a loop resembling a section of a
      finger pocket is attached to the outer edge of the index finger pocket of
      the glove of one hand to accommodate the ring finger of the player's other
      hand.

DETD
     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
PAR  The figures as outlined above, refer to a left-handed golf glove to be worn
      by a right-handed player. The invention is clearly adaptable to use by
      left-handed players using a right-handed glove having the features of this
      invention as shown in the drawing and described herein.
PAR  FIG. 1 shows the two hands of a player gripping the handle 10 of a club in
      the so-called overlapping grip. The player's left hand is in a glove 12
      having an extra pocket 14 attached to the glove between the middle and
      index fingers. The pocket 14 points in the direction opposite of the other
      finger pockets of the glove, and as shown in FIG. 1, the little finger 16
      of the player's left hand is extended into the pocket 14.
PAR  FIG. 2 is a plan view of a left-handed glove such as shown in FIG. 1. The
      extra finger pocket 14 is shown to be positioned partially between and
      extending partially over the middle and index finger pockets 22 and 24.
      The upper edge 26 of the pocket 14 preferably terminates in the vicinity
      of the position of the outer-most knuckle of the left index finger when
      the same is inserted in the index finger pocket 24. The fingertip end 28
      of the pocket 14, preferably extends a distance beyond the common
      termination point 21 of middle and index finger pockets 22 and 24. The
      length of the finger pockets 14 will preferably be approximately equal to
      the distance from the middle knuckle to the tip of the little finger of
      the right hand of a player. As shown in the perspective representation of
      FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the open end 26 of the extra pocket 14 is positioned
      partially between the middle and index finger pockets 22 and 24. The end
      portion 28 extends beyond the common termination point 21 of the finger
      pockets 22 and 24 and is fastened to the back section 23 of the glove. The
      extra finger pocket may be attached to the back of the glove and its
      adjoining finger pockets by stitching or another known method.
PAR  It will be understood that when a right-handed player grips the golf club
      in an overlapping grip, as represented in FIG. 1, the little finger 16
      will extend into the extra pocket 14. Thus, the end of the little finger
      of the right hand, when inserted in the pocket in this manner, will rest
      on the area on the back of the left hand between the knuckles of the
      middle and index fingers. When the little finger is inserted in the extra
      pocket and positioned in the manner described, the player's hands are
      interlocked in such a manner as to keep the left hand in position relative
      to the right hand. Particularly, the right hand does not have the tendency
      to open during any part of the swing, and loss of the correct grip is
      avoided.
PAR  As is apparent from the above description and the drawing, the finger
      pocket 14 overlays the back panel 23 of the glove. When this finger pocket
      14 is attached to the glove by means of peripheral stitching as indicated
      in the drawing, it is possible for a player to place the little finger of
      the right hand underneath the pocket 14. In this manner, the lower surface
      of the finger pocket acts as a restraining surface and the end portion of
      the little finger of the right hand fits snugly underneath the end portion
      28 of the finger pocket 14. When the little finger is so positioned, the
      player has a sense of interlocking of hands in the same manner as when the
      little finger is inserted in the pocket. The function of restraining the
      little finger of the right hand in the desired position between the middle
      and index fingers and overlapping the back of the left hand, may also be
      accomplished by means of a plurality of straps extending between the
      middle and index finger pockets and one or more straps attached to the
      back of the glove. Such an arrangement is shown in FIG. 5. The straps 52,
      53 and 54 extend between the middle finger pocket 22 and the index finger
      pocket 24 and are attached thereto. The strap 55 is attached to the back
      panel 23 of the glove 12. It will be understood that when the glove of
      FIG. 5 is worn by a player and a golf club is gripped in the manner
      depicted in FIG. 1, the little finger 16 of the player's right hand will
      fit underneath and be restrained by, the straps 52 through 55. When used
      in this manner, a glove having such straps aids the player to maintain a
      secure grip on the golf club.
PAR  As stated earlier herein, there is a tendency for the overlapping hand, for
      example the right hand shown in FIG. 1, to open slightly when the club is
      raised in preparation for the swing, which may result in an inadvertent
      turning of the club. This tendency of a player's hand to open is reduced
      substantially be interlocking the little finger of that hand between the
      middle and index fingers of the other hand in the manner described in the
      previous paragraphs. The same effect may be obtained by securing one of
      the other fingers of the overlapping hand, for example the ring finger.
      FIG. 6 shows a finger receptacle 62 attached to the outer edge 25 of the
      index finger pocket 24 of a left-handed glove. The receptacle 62 may be
      attached to the pocket by means of stitching or any other known means.
      When a golf club 10 is gripped by means of the overlapping grip as
      depicted in FIG. 1, the ring finger 18 of the right hand may be inserted
      into the receptacle 62. When the ring finger of the right hand is inserted
      in the receptacle 62 in the manner described, the tendency of the right
      hand to open during the swing is reduced substantially, aiding the golfer
      in maintaining the correct alignment of the club. When using a grip other
      than the overlapping grip depicted in FIG. 1, a golfer may insert another
      digit, for example, the little finger of the left hand, in the receptacle
      62.
PAR  While the invention has been illustrated by means of the examples described
      above and shown in the drawing, it will be apparent to those skilled in
      the art that other embodiments may be produced without departing from the
      scope of the present invention.
